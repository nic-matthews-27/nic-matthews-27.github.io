                       <p>Neuroplasticity is defined as the selective organising of connections between neurons in our brains. Key principles of neuroplasticity show off the idea that intelligience is malleable and with the exposure of this idea comes greater success. It is proven that people who understand neuroplasticity are seen to have a boost in morale and grade points in school. Not only do these people  do better in school, they also work better in peers and groups, hugely benefiting the way people learn.  
                           <br>
                           <br>
                    Understanding the basics of neuroplasticity has already helped me in many ways, including my confidence and motivation. Originally, I didn't know whether I was cut out for developing but since learning about this, I have gone into every task with the idea that if I can put in the work, I can be as good as anyone. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There are many ways to increase your neuroplasticity. One way  is just simply practicing, practicing and practicing. Repeating a processs causes neurons in your brain to fire together, creating electrochemical pathways. This is how muscle memory works. For example, learning a song on a guitar can be difficult at first, however after enough practice, it feels natural and easy to do. Another way to increase neuroplasticity is to find connections and relationships between contexts. Doing this has proven to generate greater brain cell activity and achieve more successful long-term memory storage and retrieval.

                       <h2 class="textdec">Growth Mindset:</h2>
                       <p>A growth mindset is simply where an individual understands that their abilities can be developed. For example, a person with  a growth mindset will see failure as a chance to learn. In a fixed mindset, a person believes that their abilities,intelligience and  talents are all fixed traits. For example, a person with a fixed mindset will see failure as permanent.
                           <br>
                           <br>
                         I'm surprised by how much having a growth mindset benefits you. It influences everything from creative risk taking, to viewing feedback positively and to whether or not you finish a task.
                         <br>
                         <br> 
                         For the rest of my learning journey, I will intergrate the growth mind set. To do this, I will never back down from challenges and will use them as tools to bettering my learning (instead of shying away from them).

                         Because I'm a visual person, I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1CHPnZfFmU" target="_blank" >this link</a> very useful for understanding growth mindset and how it differs from a fixed mindset.
