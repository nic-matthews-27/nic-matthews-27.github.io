<h1>Margin, padding and border</h1>

<h3> Margin, padding and border are CSS styling components that together make up the foundation of layout on the web. HTML elements are essentially little rectangles and within these rectangles are four layers; margin, border, padding and content. The image below gives you a visual perspective of what an element looks like in a box model (a box model is the technical term used for the little rectangle).</h3>

    <div class="box">

        <div class="content">

          <p> Border definition</p>
 <p>The border of a CSS box sits between the outer edge of the padding and the inner edge of the margin. By default, the border is individual but you can set the thickness, style and color of the border to make it appear. The border has many different styles and some examples of these styles are ‘solid’, ‘dotted’, ‘grooved’ and ‘ridged’. Added to this you can customise your border to have more of a curvature or to be more box shaped.</p>
