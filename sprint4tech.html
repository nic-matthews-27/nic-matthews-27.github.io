       There was a time I got stuck on a really small syntax error and I wasn't able to pick it out. This was very frustrating because I knew the error was so tiny. Instead of spending heaps of time on it and trying to find it, I deleted the whole lot of code and used pseudocode to write down the step by step proceedure to re-write the code. This seems to work everytime. From this I've learnt to go over my work after every step. There's nothing worse than trying to find a small typo error in a whole heap of code.

        I'm fairly confident with the pseudocode method of problem solving. I've used it in all of my kata challenges and it's helped me identify areas I'm not so confident in as well. Writing down a step by step procedure enables my brain to compartmentalise, making it easier to complete big tasks.

        I'm also confident in asking peers around me for help. Everyone is super supportive and that makes it easier for me to ask around when I'm stuck.

        I'm not too confident with console logging as I feel my understanding of javascript isn't up to a good enough level to use it/understand what it's telling me.
