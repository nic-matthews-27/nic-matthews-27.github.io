                <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
                <h3>Emotional intelligence is made up of five elements; self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy and social skills.</h3>
                    <p>Self-awareness:  The ability to monitor our internal world, our thoughts and emotions as they arise. To understand our own strengths and weaknesses and to work on them so we can perform better.</p>
                        <p>Self-regulation: This is basically the ability to think before you act. To control your emotions and impulses and to avoid making careless decisions.</p>
                        <p>Motivation: Having the ability to be highly productive, effective in whatever you do and to be open to challenges.</p>
                        <p>Empathy: The ability to identify and understand the wants, needs and viewpoints of others around you. An empathetic person goes in with an open mind set when interacting with others and doesn’t stereotype / judge people too quickly.<p>
                            <p>Social skills: People with good social skills can work well in teams. Can manage disputes, communicate well and are strong at building/maintaining relationships.</p>

                <h1>How is it different to IQ</h1>
                <p>IQ and EQ are completely different things. IQ is short for ‘Intelligence Quotient’ and is wholly focused on one’s intelligence level. IQ tests are standard tests of the brain’s technical strength, and measures things like math, logic and verbal strength. EQ (emotional quotient/intelligence) is measured on your ability to relate and interact with others. Good IQ may help you perform well in a test, but those with low IQs but high EQs may demonstrate remarkable insights with respect to people, emotions, and other areas of life. </p> </div>

                <div class="box1">
                    <h1>Why is EQ important</h1>
                    <p>Life is a sociable construct. Without the ability to function well within this relational environment, IQ can only get you so far.  Emotional intelligence helps us in so many ways: From assisting in looking after our physical and mental well-being, through to the ability to inspire and work with others. 

                            Teamwork is huge in the workplace, as it brings everyone’s skills together. Having good EQ will enable you to work well in this environment because you’re working with and interacting with many people.
