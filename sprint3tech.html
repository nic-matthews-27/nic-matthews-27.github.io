        <h2 class="align">HTML and CSS:</h2>
        
        <p>HTML and CSS are best friends as they both compliment each other in many different ways. When they are combined, they make an accessable yet stylish website. To describe them in an analogy, you could say HTML is like the foundations of a house and CSS is the art work and painting of the house. Together they make an accessable yet stylish home. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="control"> 
            <h2 class="align">Control Flow and Loops:</h2> 
            <p>The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script. These states are if, else if and else. If 'if' is false then the computer regonises this and moves onto 'else if'. If 'else if' is false then the computer moves onto the final statement 'else'. Within these statements can be pretty much anything, including maths equations and or strings. Here's a real life example of how the control flow works. Say you're in America and there's a concert with alcohol involved (r18). When you buy your tickets on the website, it will ask you for your age. People under 18 will be denied from purchasing a ticket to the concert, people between 18 and 21 will be given a special ticket that allows them to go to the concert but denies them from alcohol service, people 21 and over can go to the concert and can also purhcase alcohol. This is how 'if', 'else if' and 'else' work. 'If' is for people under 18, and for you to move on to the type of ticket you get, the statement has to be false (person over 18). 'Else if' is the next stage and for you to see whether or not you're allowed to be served alcohol, else if must fail (be between 18 and 21 years old.) </p>
        </div>
        <div class="DOM">
            <h2 class="align">DOM:</h2>
            <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface to web pages. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed/manipulated. With the DOM, programmers can build documents, identify their structure and add, modify or delete elements and content. The DOM is the tree model to represent HTML. When a web page is loaded, the browser automatically creates a Document Object Model of the page, which is an object orientated representation of any the HTML. The DOM can represent any document type, including CSS and JavaScript so it is very useful to understand the code that makes up a page and to make small temporary changes to the page. The DOM and HTML/CSS relationship is similar to the way we fork repositories on Github. Forking a document is simply creating a copy of repository and saving it to your own desktop. Changes you make on this can only been seen on your local computer, and won’t affect the real page. This is similar to the DOM because it is a representation of a file such as HTML. Changes on the DOM can only be seen on the web page (until refreshed) and doesn’t affect the actual document.
                <br>
                An example of where you might use the DOM is where you're trying out new concepts either with CSS or JavaScript. Instead of making these changes on your code editor and having to switch between screens, you can do it all on the web browser. Not only does this save time but it also enables you to be more adventurous, as changes made on the DOM don't actually change the code on the editor.

        <div class="array">
            <h2>Arrays and objects</h2>
            <p>Objects can have catergories with different objects inside them and don't have any built in order, whereas arrays only allow us to group single sets of data.  </p>
        </div>
        <div class="functions">
            <h2>Functions:</h2>
            <p> A function is composed of a sequence of statements called the fucntion body. Functions can be passed to a function, and the function will return a value. Functions are useful for cleaner code writing and many other things. </p>
