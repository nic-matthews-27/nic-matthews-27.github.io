                            <h1>Identity, values and strenths</h1>
                        <p>In this sprint, I have been able to look deeper into myself as a person and more towards the values that make me who I am. I know myself to be a super loving and caring person as to me having good relationships with people is the most important aspect of life. Socialising and meeting new people is something that I have always loved doing and because of this I am super excited to meet the other students in my cohort. In the two weeks that I have been in Wellington, I have been fortunate enough to make many new friends. 
                    
                            When it comes to my strengths, I know myself to be a very hard worker. I always want to be the best I can be and from past experiences I have learnt the key strengths of persistence and determination. Even though I find it quite hard to list out things that I’m good at, I am proud to list the fact that I can work well in teams. Teamwork is a huge part of web-development and to me that is super appealing. Adding one’s strengths with another makes a well-oiled machine and that’s what makes any project fun. IT has so many areas and it’s nearly impossible for someone to be good at everything, hence why teamwork is key. Not being good at everything brings me onto weaknesses. As I stated before, I find building relationships with others the most important thing in life and at times this can make me become self-conscious. Everyone has their own insecurities and for me it can make me hide in shell at times.
