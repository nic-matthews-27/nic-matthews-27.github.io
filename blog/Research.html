    <H1 class="border" id="Padding"> Margin, Border, and Padding</H1>
    <br>
    <p class="paragraph" id="width-of-text">Margin, padding and border are CSS styling components that together make up the foundation of layout on the web. HTML elements are essentially little rectangles and within these rectangles are four layers; margin, border, padding and content. The image below gives you a visual perspective of what an element looks like in a box model (a box model is the technical term used for the little rectangle). 


      <div>
          <p class="KP">Padding definition: Padding refers to the inner margin of a CSS box — between the outer edge of the content box and the inner edge of the border. The size of this layer can be set on all four sides at once with the padding shorthand property, or one side at a time with the padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom and padding-left properties.</p>
      </div>
<h3>Border definition: The border of a CSS box sits between the outer edge of the padding and the inner edge of the margin. By default the border has a size of 0 — making it invisible — but you can set the thickness, style and color of the border to make it appear. The border shorthand property allows you to set all of these on all four sides at once, for example border: 1px solid black. This can be broken down into numerous different longhand properties for more specific styling needs:</h3>
<p>The border is what wraps around the content and padding</p>
     <h3>Margin: The margin surrounds a CSS box, and pushes up against other CSS boxes in the layout. It behaves rather like padding; the shorthand property is margin and the individual properties are margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, and margin-left.</h3>
